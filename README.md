Calculator Project

As part of my journey as a self-taught front-end web developer, I built a fully functional calculator application. 
This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
Clear and Reset Functions: Users can clear their current input or reset the entire calculation, ensuring flexibility in usage.
Keyboard Support: Keyboard Support not available because i used onclick event only.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structured the content and layout of the calculator.
CSS: Styled the calculator for a clean and modern appearance.
JavaScript: Implemented the functionality, including event handling and arithmetic operations.
